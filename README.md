This is a small project where I implemented a design I saw on Dribbble using Compose, credits to the designer Mickael Guillaume.
You can check his [Dribbble account](https://dribbble.com/mickaeldll)

# I've used:
- Kotlin
- Jetpack **Compose**
- [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for dependency injection
- Coil for loading images
